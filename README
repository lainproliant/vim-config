------- Lee's Vim Configs -------

These are my personal Vim configs.  They are a collection of my vimrc,
gvimrc, plugins, extra syntax files, and color schemes I have collected.

I will document the plugins, settings, and ctags files included in this package
below.


------- Plugins and Such -------

ScrollColor.vim:   
   Enables a command ":SCROLL" which allows you to scroll through all of your
   installed colorschemes and see which one you like with your currently open
   buffers.

------- Happy Colorschemes -------

There are many colorschemes included in this package, most are from the Vim
Color Scheme Test at http://code.google.com/p/vimcolorschemetest/

Several of the colorschemes are my own!

auburn (gvim):
   A strictly dark orange color theme.  Designed to look like an old auburn
   text terminal if it had brightness-based highlighting capabilities.

malice (gvim):
   Similar to auburn, but in green.

contempt (gvim):
   Honestly, not very readable and has bad contrast.  Don't use this one.

pacificc (gvim):
   A colorscheme honoring the wonderful old DOS C compiler and IDE from
   Hi-tech Software.  I love this colorscheme.

lainproliant (vim)
   A theme I'm working on.  For color terminals, loosely based on pacificc,
   but written before it, so maybe not.
